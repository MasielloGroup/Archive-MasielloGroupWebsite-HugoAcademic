David Masiello is a Professor of Chemistry, Adjunct Professor of Applied Mathematics, and Adjunct Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. 

The Masiello Research Group is composed of theoreticians with backgrounds in chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, materials science and engineering, and applied mathematics working at the interface of plasmonics, nanophotonics, and quantum optics. Our research is aimed at providing insight and understanding to the discovery of optical, magnetic, electronic, and thermal phenomena spanning from the nanoscale to many tens of microns. Connection to experiment is integral to our work is connected deeply to experimental efforts worldwide.
