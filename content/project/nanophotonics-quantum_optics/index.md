The interaction between light and matter is extraordinarily weak. Incorporation of optical resonator cavities provides an opportunity to coax repeated interaction and enhance coupling far beyond that of free space. In such settings, light-matter coupling can be so strong that it is no longer possible to disentangle the original optical and material degrees of freedom, resulting in non-equilibrium quantum optical states. Together with experiment we develop theoretical models and simulation tools necessary to explicitly connect nanophotonic cavity + qubit systems with quantum many-body processes and phenomena. Our work not only enables the simulation of quantum many-body physics in nanophotonic devices but also provides opportunities to protect fragile quantum correlations against decoherence.
