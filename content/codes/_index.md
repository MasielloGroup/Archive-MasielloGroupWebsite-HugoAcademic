See our Github site for relevant group codes:

* **<a href=https://github.com/MasielloGroup/t-dda>t-DDA</a>: Calculation of steady-state temperature profile**  
This code calculates the steady-state temperature distribution of nanoparticles on a semi-infinite substrate, embedded in a semi-infinite background medium by solving the discretized steady-state heat diffusion equation.  

* **<a href=https://github.com/MasielloGroup/eDDA>eDDA</a>: Electron Beam Driven Discrete Dipole Approximation**  
This code is a modified version of Draine's Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) code version 7.1. We have modified the code to to allow for an electron beam excitation source. The code computes the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)) and angle-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) for both aloof and internal geometries.  

* **<a href=https://github.com/MasielloGroup/qutip>QuTiP</a>: Quantum Toolbox in Python**  
QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems. The QuTiP library uses the excellent Numpy, Scipy, and Cython packages as numerical backend, and graphical output is provided by Matplotlib. QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a wide variety of quantum mechanical problems, including those with Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of physics applications. QuTiP is freely available for use and/or modification, and it can be used on all Unix-based platforms and on Windows. Being free of any licensing fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics in research as well as in the classroom.  

* **<a href=https://github.com/MasielloGroup/confocal_photothermal_pipeline>Confocal Photothermal Image Pipeline</a>**  
This set of files creates confocal photothermal images by calculating the light scattered by metallic nanoparticle assemblies.
