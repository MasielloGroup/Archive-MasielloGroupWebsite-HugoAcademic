This page contains the source code and makefile for the thermal discrete-dipole approximation (T-DDA) 1.0 code. The T-DDA calculates the steady-state temperature distribution within and surrounding an externally-illuminated target immersed in a homogeneous background medium. The method utilizes lattice Green's function and projection operator techniques to efficiently invert the system of equations that arises from discretizing the target and environment. Note that BLAS and LAPACK are required to run this program.
